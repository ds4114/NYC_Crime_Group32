## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r NYC Crime}
data <- read.csv("/Users/Dogar/Desktop/Columbia Material/Fall 2022/EDAV/Group Project/NYPD_Complaint_Data_Current__Year_To_Date_.csv")
```

## Add a column with location of our interest - say Columbia University.
```{r}
data$lat_loc = 40.807384
data$lon_loc = -73.963036
```

## Now calculate distances for each crime from our point of interest
``` {r}
library(geosphere)
data$dist <- apply(data, 1, function(x)distm(c(x[34],x[33]),c(x[38],x[37]),fun = distGeo))

```

## Selecting only those points that are within a 1000m of our point of interest
``` {r}
# Keeping only those observations that are within 1 km from columbia
columbia <- data[data$dist <= 1000,]
```

# Visualizing our points on google maps
``` {r}
# Plottting columbia data on a map
library(ggmap)
register_google(key = "AIzaSyDUVtOF3qSoJEcQAZ9mU0E1rGKQDqcuNGw")
map = get_googlemap(center = c(lon = -73.963036, lat = 40.807384),zoom = 15)
ggmap(map) + geom_point(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), data = columbia, size = 1, color = 'red')

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
